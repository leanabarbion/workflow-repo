# End of Day Process Workflow

## Introduction
The End of Day Process Workflow is designed to automate and orchestrate the closing activities of daily operations across multiple technology platforms. This workflow enhances efficiency, reduces manual errors, and ensures data integrity by seamlessly integrating various systems for a comprehensive end-of-day execution.

## Use Case Overview
Organizations require a streamlined process to conclude daily operations, ensuring that data is collected, processed, and transferred appropriately across different environments. The objectives of this workflow include automating database updates, transferring files, executing data pipelines, performing backups, invoking serverless applications, and preparing for subsequent operations in Azure services — all culminating in a ready state for the following day.

## Technical Implementation
The workflow is composed of a sequence of jobs, each performing specific tasks critical to the end-of-day activities. 

1. **JobDatabaseSQLScript**: This job is executed first to run SQL scripts against the operational database, committing necessary updates or archiving older data. It forms the foundation for downstream dependencies.

2. **JobFileTransfer**: Following the SQL job, files generated or modified during the day are securely transferred using specified protocols (e.g., SFTP) to a designated storage location, ensuring that all relevant data artifacts are available for processing.

3. **AWS_DataPipeline**: This job orchestrates the transformation of data, extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data as required for long-term storage or further analytical processing. Dependencies on the completion of the file transfer job must be satisfied before execution.

4. **AWS_Backup**: A critical component, this job creates a backup of the databases and essential data files to ensure data recovery in case of failures or data loss. It waits for the SQL script completion as a prerequisite.

5. **AWS_Lambda**: This serverless function is invoked to perform lightweight computations or data processing tasks after the backup completes, allowing for rapid execution without provisioning resources.

6. **AWS_SQS**: A message queue service that is utilized to manage communication between distributed systems. This job sends notifications or messages indicating the completion of previous tasks, facilitating subsequent job execution.

7. **AWS_CloudFormation**: This job is responsible for ensuring that all required AWS resources are correctly configured and ready for future operations, automating infrastructure as code.

8. **AZURE_DataFactory**: Next, it ingests the processed data for analytics purposes or further operational tasks in the Azure environment, depending on previous job outputs, thus maintaining efficient cross-cloud operations.

9. **AZURE_LogicApps**: This job orchestrates workflows that integrate various services, enabling automated data processing flows based on the outputs from Azure Data Factory jobs.

10. **AWS_AppRunner**: Lastly, this job deploys applications or services into a managed execution environment, preparing the cloud infrastructure for the next day’s tasks.

### Error Handling and Recovery
Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented at each job stage. Each job's failure triggers an alert via AWS_SQS, allowing for immediate notifications to operators. Workflows incorporate retry mechanisms on transient failures, while critical failures initiate rollback processes or alert designated support teams for manual intervention.

### Performance Considerations
To optimize performance, jobs are scheduled to run during off-peak hours to minimize impact on operational systems. Dependency management is finely tuned to ensure that jobs do not proceed until prerequisites are satisfactorily completed, thus avoiding bottlenecks. Additionally, the workflow includes logging and monitoring to analyze performance metrics and optimize resource allocation.
