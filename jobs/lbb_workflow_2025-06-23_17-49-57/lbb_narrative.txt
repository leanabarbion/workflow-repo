# Clinical Trial Data Aggregation Workflow

## Introduction
The Clinical Trial Data Aggregation Workflow is designed to streamline the collection, cleansing, and analysis of clinical trial data from multiple research sites. By harnessing cloud-based technologies, this workflow enhances data integrity and compliance with data protection regulations, ultimately facilitating timely and accurate reporting for regulatory reviews. The business value lies in improving operational efficiency while ensuring adherence to trial protocols.

## Use Case Overview
The business need for this workflow arises from the necessity to efficiently aggregate and process diverse clinical trial datasets from various sources. The objectives are to ensure the data is cleansed and consistent, perform interim analyses to gauge trial progress, and produce comprehensive reports that comply with regulatory standards. This approach enables stakeholders to make informed decisions while sustaining compliance with data protection frameworks.

## Technical Implementation
The workflow operates through a sequential and interdependent method, where each step is contingent upon the successful completion of the preceding job, ensuring data integrity and minimizing errors.

1. **Data Flow Between Jobs**:
   - The process begins with **AWS_AppFlow**, which facilitates the secure extraction of clinical trial data from multiple research sites and sends this data to a designated storage solution.
   - Following data extraction, **AWS_Backup** ensures that the raw data is securely backed up in accordance with regulatory requirements.
   - The next phase involves **AWS_QuickSight**, which ingests the cleansed data to perform preliminary analyses and visualizations.
   - Subsequently, **AWS_DataSync** is used to efficiently transfer the processed data to a final repository or analytical framework for detailed reporting.
   - The workflow culminates with **AZURE_Functions**, where custom scripts can be executed to carry out additional processing, generate reports, and deliver insights for regulatory compliance.

2. **Dependencies and Relationships**:
   - Each job in the workflow is closely linked, with **AWS_AppFlow** as the first job feeding into **AWS_Backup**. This ensures that only the latest valid data is backed up.
   - **AWS_Backup** must successfully complete before **AWS_QuickSight** can run.
   - Following the analyses in **AWS_QuickSight**, the results are sent to **AWS_DataSync**, which then prepares the data for final reporting through **AZURE_Functions**, necessitating precise execution before the analysis script can be run.

3. **Error Handling and Recovery**:
   - Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented at each stage. Should any job fail, it will trigger an alert for immediate investigation.
   - The workflow includes checkpoints; if a job fails, upon recovery, it can resume from the last successful checkpoint rather than restarting the entire process.
   - In cases of data integrity errors detected during the cleansing process, fallback procedures ensure that previous validated versions of the data can be accessed for re-analysis.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Performance is optimized through the efficient use of cloud resources, minimizing latency in data transfer and processing.
   - Regular monitoring of job execution times allows for identifying bottlenecks, and scalability features of AWS ensure that increased workloads can be handled without degradation in performance.
